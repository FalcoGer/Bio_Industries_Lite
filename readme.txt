This mod is intended to tone down the Bio Industries Mod.
I believe TheSAguy did a great job with the original mod, however I also believe that he got a bit too excited in adding new content. Each one of the machines he added could and in my opinion should've been a separate mod.
This has not been done and I find myself wanting to install half the mod while absolutely not wanting to use the other half.
Then this mods adds a lot of things that are ridiculous, such as changing the vanilla recipe for rails, making use of the new "crushed stone" recipe. To me that is an instant show stopper.
Then there is the matter of the rather unfitting sprites for some of the buildings, such as the solar stuff that just don't fit into the factorio artstyle.
And of course solar roadways are a stupid and ridiculous idea.

What I want is a concise and to the point mod that doesn't add a lot of items but a lot of gameplay. That means no wooden fences or 5 different types of wooden chests or intermediate products that have just a single use or very few uses. That means no crushed stone, no liquid air, no wooden rails or big wooden power poles or anything like that.
I want no vanilla changes. And I want no superfluous scripts that bog down the game.
So what's left in this mod then?

- Wood growing inside the greenhouse (no or simple fertilizer, not using crushed stone (but just stone))
- Wood processing into Coal using the cookery. (No charcoal)
- Biomass processing into plastic and fuel

Everything else has been or will be stripped.
